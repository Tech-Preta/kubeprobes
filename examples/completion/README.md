# Completion Examples and Evidence

This directory contains evidence and examples of the kubeprobes auto-completion functionality.

## Files

- **COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md**: Complete evidence showing the auto-completion scripts generated for all supported shells
- **TERMINAL_DEMO.md**: Realistic terminal session demonstrations showing auto-completion in action
- **demo.sh**: Interactive demo script to test and verify auto-completion functionality
- **kubeprobes_bash_completion.sh**: Generated bash completion script (338 lines)
- **kubeprobes_zsh_completion.zsh**: Generated zsh completion script (212 lines)
- **kubeprobes_fish_completion.fish**: Generated fish completion script (235 lines)
- **kubeprobes_powershell_completion.ps1**: Generated PowerShell completion script (245 lines)

## Quick Test

Run the demonstration script to see auto-completion in action:

```bash
./demo.sh
```

## Manual Verification

To manually test the auto-completion:

```bash
# Load bash completion
source <(../../bin/kubeprobes completion bash)

# Test command completion
../../bin/kubeprobes <TAB>
# Should show: completion  help  scan

# Test subcommand completion
../../bin/kubeprobes completion <TAB>
# Should show: bash  fish  powershell  zsh
```

## Documentation

For complete setup instructions and documentation, see:
- [docs/completion.md](../../docs/completion.md) - Full auto-completion documentation
- [README.md](../../README.md) - Main project documentation with completion section

## Testing

The auto-completion functionality is tested in the `internal/cli/completion_test.go` file, which verifies:
- Bash completion script generation
- All shell completion script generation (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
- Completion command existence and functionality

Run tests with:
```bash
go test ./internal/cli -v
```

All completion scripts have been verified to:
1. Generate without errors
2. Contain proper shell-specific syntax
3. Pass syntax validation for their respective shells
4. Provide working auto-completion when sourced
